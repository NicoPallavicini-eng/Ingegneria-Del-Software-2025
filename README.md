## How to run
### Server
1. Open the prompt as **administrator**.
2. Deactivate your antivirus and firewall services 
[```BE CAREFUL! Do that only in a safe network```]
```bash
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
```
3. Launch jar file using the following command (**pay attention to your directory**): 
```bash
java -jar pathToServerLauncher\ServerLauncher.jar
```
5. When finished playing, remember to reactivate your security settings:
```bash
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
```
### Client
1. Open the prompt as **administrator**.
2. Deactivate your antivirus and firewall services
      [```BE CAREFUL! Do that only in a safe network```]
```bash
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off
```
3. Launch jar file using the following command (**pay attention to your directory**):
```bash
java -jar pathToClientLauncher\ClientLauncher.jar
```
4. Select the communication protocol and the UI preferred.
5. Insert Server Ip address or press -1 for localhost.
6. When finished playing, remember to reactivate your security settings:
```bash
netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on
```

## How to play
1. When you launch the clientJar you will be able to choose your preferred network protocol (RMI/TCP) and user Interface (TUI/GUI).
2. You will then proceed with the nickname selection and max number of players selection (if needed).
3. The game will start when the correct number of connected clients is reached.
